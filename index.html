      <p class="resumetextsmall">Simple Calculator: Calculator that can compute basic operations such as multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, along with commands
        like clear and backspace. This project was important for me to brush up on my HTML/CSS skills, especially for the clean user interface and gif

        bot.
